  description: "In 2017, City of Oakland expanded their medical cannabis licensing to include regulation for cultivation and manufacturing. As part of this activity, the City also codified an Equity Licensing Program to address barriers to participation in the industry for members of disenfranchised communities in Oakland. This program includes a provision for \"equity business incubators\" to support new businesses in the industry. Equity businesses in the pipeline will be importantant to regular applicants, because regular licenses will only be issued on a one-to-one basis with equity licenses during the initial phase of the program. The incubator opportunity is intended to help new enterprises overcome the barrier of securing commercial space by incentivizing more established businesses to agree to share their existing space for a minimum of three years. By partnering with an equity business, a regular applicant will be moved to the top of the list for the next available non-equity cannabis business license.

  To support the Equity Licensing Program, OpenOakland provided support to other volunteer technologists and cannabis entrepreneurs working with the City of Oakland’s City Administrator’s Office and the Department of Race and Equity to develop [CannaEquity.org](http://cannaequity.org/), an online \"matchmaking\" application that would assist interested equity and regular applicants to locate each other efficiently. Applicants would create online accounts to pre-screen for compatibility and control the pace of information sharing and relationship building needed for the formation of space-sharing relationships. The app will be maintained until the end of phase one of licensing. This date will be determined by the collection of cannabis tax revenue sufficient to launch the next phase of equity applicant support services (assumed to be within one year)."

  description: Discount Mobility helped low income residents get access to scooter share, bike share and car share programs. While every company has discount programs for low income residents, the application process is fragmented and these benefits aren't widely known. We unified the application for these programs and engaged in outreach so people were aware of this benefit.

  description: OUSD doesn’t provide resources for school websites, but many parents prospective families expect them to. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, La Escuelita K-8 elementary needed a simple website to house essential info for student and families. Facing an almost-overnight move to remote learning, the need for an easily maintained site became even more critical. OpenOakland worked closely with parents and school staff to develop a site to connect students and families to the school, without a lot of overhead by school staff.
