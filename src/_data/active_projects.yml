  description: The WOAQ team is building an air quality database with the nonprofit West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project (WOEIP), who has been collecting local air quality data for over a decade. Our initial effort is focused on a volunteer-friendly database for WOEIP staff and volunteers to manage and explore the local AQ data they collect through the organization’s citizen science program. We’ll then build on this to create a neighborhood-friendly platform that allows residents to act on this data through self-education, self-empowerment, and civic engagement.
